Help for SET BADPASSWDMSG:

SET BADPASSWDMSG controls whether services tells you about
failed password-based logins as they occur.

This command takes one of 3 options; ON, OFF, or DEFAULT.
If it is ON, services will tell you about failed logins as
they occur. If it is OFF, it will not. If it is DEFAULT, it
will behave as configured by network staff. The default can
be changed by network staff at any time, so you may want to
set an explicit ON or OFF.

This does not affect login attempts that do not use your
account password, as no real-time notices are ever sent for
such login attempts.

Regardless of the setting, you will still receive a notice
when you login telling you how many failed logins have
occurred since your last successful login, and where the
latest failed login attempt originated.

Syntax: SET BADPASSWDMSG ON|OFF|DEFAULT

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET BADPASSWDMSG ON
